# Silex Dashboard

Here is the source code of Silex dashboard. It is a [Silex](https://www.silex.me) plugin which can be installed to manage websites you will then edit in Silex.

Technically, the dashboard is an [11ty](https://11ty.dev) website with a design made in Silex + [a vue.js app](https://vuejs.org/) which interacts with Silex API
